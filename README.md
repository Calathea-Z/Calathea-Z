I am a skilled software engineer with a diverse background in music and kitchen management. My experiences have given me valuable skills in teamwork, problem-solving and adaptability. I love to travel, attend concerts and ride my bike. I currently reside in Asheville, North Carolina, where I work with my coding partner, Suzie the French Bulldog. I am open to new opportunities and eager to continue growing my skills and experience.
