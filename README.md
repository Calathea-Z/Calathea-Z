I am a software engineer that grew up working in kitchens where I gained eight years of experience building and cultivating teams as the Head Kitchen Manager at Asheville Pizza & Brewing Company. Iâ€™m passionate about finding elegant and efficient solutions to difficult problems. I specialize in full-stack Javascript Technologies (MERN Stack). When I'm not coding you will probably find me at a concert, cycling, or planning my next excursion to a new part of the world. Please get in touch with any questions or suggestions about anything you find here on my github.
